## 🎉 Plugin Features

**-- Affiliate Dashboard & Coupon Usage Statistics --**

On the affiliate dashboard, you and your affiliate users will be able to view the usage statistics for their referral coupon, and more including:

* Coupon code details
* Total sales via coupon
* Total amount saved via coupon
* Total commission earned by affiliate via coupon
* Latest orders that have used the coupon
* List of products purchased in each order
* Referral URL, including clicks and conversion
* and more...

**-- Affiliate Commission Tracking & Accurate Calculations --**

* Your affiliates (and you) can see the total commission earned via the coupon, and view commission earned for each individual order in the recent orders list.

* You can set 3 types of commission amounts, including fixed commission "per product" or "per order", as well as a percentage of the total order. You can also set all 3 of these for more unique & flexible commission calculations!

**-- Recent Orders List --**

* Affiliates can view a recent order list for their coupon, with general info such as date, order subtotal, discount, total, products purchased, commission earned etc. A monthly orders/commission summary is also included in Pro.

* They can also view combined totals (total sales, total commission etc) for all orders within the date range selected, on both the 'recent orders' and 'monthly summary' tables.

**-- Affiliate Referral URLs --**

* Affiliates can generate a referral URL via the affiliate tool which automatically applies the coupon at checkout for visitors using their link.

* They can also view total clicks, usage, and conversion rate for their referral URL on the affiliate dashboard.

* A table will also be displayed, with a list of all the recent clicks/visits from the referral URL. Information displayed includes click ID, landing page, referring URL, campaign name, date/time, and if the click has "converted" into a sale.

**-- Assign Users to Coupons --**

* Assign/link user accounts to coupon codes, to give them direct private access to their affiliate dashboards for each coupon.

* A login form will be displayed on the affiliate dashboard page for logged out users (if a unique dashboard URL isn't selected). If this user is assigned to any coupons, it will automatically display the affiliate dashboard for coupon(s) assigned to the logged in user. The unique dashboard URLs will still work too, but will be made private to that user only (and admins).

* You will be able to view all the WooCommerce coupons that are assigned to each individual user, in the admin users list (along with some quick links). You can also filter the users list to only show the affiliate users.

**-- Limit to New Customers Only --**

* Want to only reward commission for new customers? An option is available to limit coupons to only be used by new customers on their first order. This can be enabled globally, or individually per coupon.

**-- Admin Reports & Analytics --**

* Get access to admin reports for the past 2 weeks. Reports allow you to see the overall WooCommerce coupon usage stats, and sales for all coupons, and each individual coupon, on a single page.

* With the Pro version get access to unlimited date range on the admin reports, export to CSV, and access to date comparison features, to compare analytics between 2 sets of dates.

**-- Email Notifications --**

* Automatically send email notifications to affiliates when their coupon code is used, to let them know they have earned new commission. You can also customise the emails with your own message.

**-- Fraud Prevention --**

* Fraud prevention is an important part of any affiliate program. We have implemented several powerful features and options to help stop fraudulent sales! <a href="https://couponaffiliates.com/docs/affiliate-fraud-prevention">Learn more.</a>

**-- WooCommerce Subscriptions --**

* Coupon Affiliates includes free integration with the official "WooCommerce Subscriptions" plugin. This means you can offer affiliates referring commission for subscription renewals, or optionally toggle this off to only reward commission for the first order. Take things a step further with PRO, and set a limit on exactly how many renewals are rewarded.

**-- Multi-Currency Support --**

* With Coupon Affiliates, you can enable multi-currency support and easily set conversion rates for all your store currencies.

* This will then automatically convert the order totals, total stats, and commission earned, in the affiliate dashboard to your base store currency, no matter which currency each of the orders were made in.

## 🎨 Admin Management & Customisation

Easily manage and customise your affiliate program.

**-- Coupons List & Dashboard Links --**

* Admins can view a list of all coupon stats, and their unique link in the admin area. This unique link can be shared with users/affiliates for them to view their coupons affiliate dashboard (or you can view it yourself).

**-- Plugin Customisation & Settings --**

* A large variety of settings are available to modify the plugin features, and affiliate dashboard, to meet your specific requirements.

**-- Flexible Commission Options --**

* You can choose between 3 different commission types, or even combine all 3. These include fixed commission amounts (either per order, or per product), alongside percentage of the total order. For example, you could have 5% of the total order, plus $1 extra per product.

**-- Orders Affiliate Info --**

* An "Affiliate Info" column will be added to the orders list, as well as a meta box widget in single orders. This will show coupon code used, affiliate user, commission for that order, and a link to the affiliate dashboard.

**-- Coupon Marketing Campaigns & More --**

* The plugin can also be used for your coupon marketing campaigns to view sales, usage statistics, and more yourself, instead of for affiliates. Or for managing your ambassador program.

* Will also work great for influencer marketing, or for a refer a friend program.

## 🔥 Getting Started

**-- Ready to increase sales with your new affiliate program? --**

Setup your own affiliate WooCommerce system in minutes. Then launch your coupon affiliate marketing program to help increase your sales!

To get started, simply add the shortcode [couponaffiliates] to a new page. This will assign it as the dashboard parent for generating the unique dashboard page links, which you can share with affiliates.

Upon installation, a small setup wizard will help you get started and automatically generate the affiliate dashboard page for you.

**-- Migrating from another Affiliates Plugin? --**

Migration of affiliate data to Coupon Affiliates is super simple, since for the most part it uses the existing data that's stored by WooCommerce.

Once you install the plugin, it will look back at the full order history for each coupon, even those created before the installation, and display the stats & commission for these on the coupon affiliate dashboard. All you'll need to do is assign your affiliate users to coupon codes, configure the settings, then you're good to go!
